                <h4>4. Cookies</h4>
                <p>
                    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. 
                    Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. 
                    Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie 
                    on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user 
                    will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the application process may require cookies to 
                    function properly. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance 
                    the experience on our site. We do not use advertising cookies or allow third parties to place cookies on our site.

                    While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information,
